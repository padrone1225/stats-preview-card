### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to add animation using TailwindCSS.

```html
<div className="animate-[slideIn_1s_ease-out]"></div>
```

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
